Welcome to the BootstrapNFT documentation. BootstrapNFT is an NFT liquidity auction platform. By establishing a liquidity market for NFT projects and conducting a "Dutch auction" (the auction price will decrease in order from high to low), it enables healthy and stable price discovery of NFT assets.

Any issuer with an NFT can build a vault and mint a fungible ERC20 token (vToken). After the NFT is fragmented, the issuer can establish a liquidity startup pool and set the weight of the custom liquidity pool, which can be either linear or exponential, so as to adjust the value of the token and prevent early speculation and speculation. New NFT prices skyrocketed.

The BootstrapNFT project attempts to solve the chaos in the NFT market such as opaque pricing and robot preemption, so that people have enough opportunities to participate in transactions at fair prices.

$BSN is BootstrapNFT’s governance token and can provide liquidity to different BootstrapNFT token pairs.

## F&Q

What is NFT Fragmentation?
Fragmented NFTs are NFTs that are broken down into fragments, allowing them to be sold individually. Each buyer of these shards will own a fraction of the overall value of the NFT. This enables long-tail users to partially buy unaffordable NFTs, and allows NFT holders to immediately cash out part of the NFT’s value without necessarily having to sell them outright.

Why does it need to be fragmented and then auctioned?

Improve the liquidity of NFT transactions and exert the value of asset liquidity;
Allow more users to trade NFTs at lower prices, and ordinary users can easily participate in blue-chip projects;
Reduced risk of NFT investments;
Fragmented NFTs can provide a price discovery mechanism to determine the value of a particular NFT. (As fragmented ERC-20 tokens are sold on the open market, their prices help provide a reasonable valuation for the price of tokenized assets.)
